# TaskLU

A collaborative group management platform designed to streamline task coordination, role assignment, deadline management, and team scheduling. 

## Description/Usage

TaskLU is a group management application built to help teams stay organized, accountable, and aligned. This platform centralizes task management, role assignment, progress tracking, and meeting scheduling in one place, reducing communication errors and missed deadlines. 

This application addresses common collaboration issues such as unclear responsibilities, fragmented task tracking, and inefficient meeting coordination. By combining structured task workflows with a shared availability calendar, TaskLU enables teams to plan effectively, monitor progress in real time, and make informed scheduling decisions. This makes it especially useful for student project teams, academic groups, and small collaborative teams.
