# TaskLU

A collaborative group management platform designed to streamline task coordination, role assignment, deadline management, and team scheduling. 

## Description/Usage

TaskLU is an individual project management application built to help solo users stay organized, accountable, and focused. This platform centralizes personal task management, priority setting, and progress tracking in a single interface, reducing the risk of overlooked details and missed deadlines.

The application addresses common personal productivity challenges such as scattered planning, fragmented task tracking, and inefficient time management. By combining structured individual workflows with a dedicated availability calendar, TaskLU enables a user to plan effectively, monitor personal milestones in real time, and make informed scheduling decisions. This makes it an essential tool for individual students, freelancers, and independent professionals seeking to master their own workflows.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality and Readability

- Code must follow proper syntax and be free of runtime errors.
- Code must be clearly commented where logic is non-trivial.
- Naming conventions must be consistent (camelCase for variables and functions,
- PascalCase for components/classes).

### Clear and Meaningful Naming

- Variable and function names must be descriptive, concise, and relevant to their purpose.
- Names should avoid ambiguity and not be overly similar to existing identifiers.
- Underscores may be used only where appropriate and consistently.

### Feature Completeness

- Each commit must implement a clearly defined piece of functionality related to an assigned feature.
- Partial or placeholder functionality must be explicitly labeled as such.

### UI & User Interaction (If Applicable)

- User-facing features must include a visible and usable UI component.
- UI elements must respond correctly to user input without causing crashes or inconsistent states.

### Independence & Modularity

- Code should not break or modify another team member’s feature without coordination.
- Feature logic should be modular and reasonably self-contained.

### Testing & Stability

- Code must compile/run successfully before being merged.
- No new warnings, errors, or regressions should be introduced.

### Documentation

- Any new feature or major change must be briefly documented in the README or relevant documentation file.
- Assumptions, limitations, or dependencies must be clearly noted.
