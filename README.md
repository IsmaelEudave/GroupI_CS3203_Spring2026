# TaskLU

A collaborative group management platform designed to streamline task coordination, role assignment, deadline management, and team scheduling. 

## Description/Usage

TaskLU is a group management application built to help teams stay organized, accountable, and aligned. This platform centralizes task management, role assignment, progress tracking, and meeting scheduling in one place, reducing communication errors and missed deadlines. 

This application addresses common collaboration issues such as unclear responsibilities, fragmented task tracking, and inefficient meeting coordination. By combining structured task workflows with a shared availability calendar, TaskLU enables teams to plan effectively, monitor progress in real time, and make informed scheduling decisions. This makes it especially useful for student project teams, academic groups, and small collaborative teams.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality and Readability

- Code must follow proper syntax and be free of runtime errors.
- Code must be clearly commented where logic is non-trivial.
- Naming conventions must be consistent (camelCase for variables and functions,
- PascalCase for components/classes).

### Clear and Meaningful Naming

- Variable and function names must be descriptive, concise, and relevant to their purpose.
- Names should avoid ambiguity and not be overly similar to existing identifiers.
- Underscores may be used only where appropriate and consistently.

### Feature Completeness

- Each commit must implement a clearly defined piece of functionality related to an assigned feature.
- Partial or placeholder functionality must be explicitly labeled as such.

### UI & User Interaction (If Applicable)

- User-facing features must include a visible and usable UI component.
- UI elements must respond correctly to user input without causing crashes or inconsistent states.

### Independence & Modularity

- Code should not break or modify another team member’s feature without coordination.
- Feature logic should be modular and reasonably self-contained.

### Testing & Stability

- Code must compile/run successfully before being merged.
- No new warnings, errors, or regressions should be introduced.

### Documentation

- Any new feature or major change must be briefly documented in the README or relevant documentation file.
- Assumptions, limitations, or dependencies must be clearly noted.
